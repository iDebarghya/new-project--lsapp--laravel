# new-project--lsapp--laravel *Details*

I've made a website using laravel. This is a basic website that contains: Home, About, Services & Index pages. Along with this there is the blog page. My main emphasis in on the blog page.

The blog page shows all the posts by different users. Users may upload pictures if they desire while creating a post. Guest users can only view the posts, new users can register, and existing users can login. Pagination, timestamps, ck-editor and other features are included.

The whole project cannot be uploaded as there are too many files. However, I've uploaded the files I created.
